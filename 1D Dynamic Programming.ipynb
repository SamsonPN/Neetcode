    "* reason why we do this:\n",
    "    1. Consider the case where there are no zeroes in the array\n",
    "    2. If there are an even number of negatives in the array, then the max product is just the product of the entire array (because two negatives product a positive)\n",
    "    3. If there are an odd number of negatives in the array, then you need to exclude one of the negative numbers* so you are left with an even number of negatives (you don't know which negative to exclude). To exclude a number, take the subarray to the left of it or to the right of it.\n",
    "    4. So you need either the product of A[i] where i in [0, k - 1] or where i in [k + 1, len(A) - 1] for some k, where k in [0, len(A)] (len(a) is inclusive because you might need the entire array, e.g. if the array has length 1).\n",
    "    5. You don't know which number to pivot around (i.e. the correct value of k) or which side (left or right) to take. So try all left sides (see the first loop). Then, try all right sides (see the second loop). Take the best result.\n",
    "    6. Now modify this approach to work for arrays with zeroes. You just need to use the multiplicative identity 1 to \"reset\" after seeing a zero.\n",
    "* dp algorithm:\n",
    "    1. keep track of the max and min as you go along from left --> right\n",
    "    2. max = Math.max(max * nums[i], min * nums[i], nums[i])\n",
    "    3. min = Math.max(max * nums[i], min * nums[i], nums[i])\n",
    "        - reason why we need to keep track of both max AND min is b/c of NEGATIVE numbers in the array\n",
    "        - so if max = 3, min = -3, and nums[i] = -10\n",
    "            * max * nums[i] = -30\n",
    "            * min * nums[i] = 30\n",
    "            * so the max and min have essentially switched places\n",
    "        - and the reason why we also need to take a look at nums[i] for the comparison too is because the previous max/min could be 0 (due to being multiplied with a 0 previously)\n",
