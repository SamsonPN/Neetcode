    "    - we are actually repeating some subproblems so we can use a dp table to keep track of those and return immediately\n",

    "        * and this also helps with initializing the first row as well since we know that dp[0][j] = 0 for j >= 1\n",
    "            - this is b/c we cannot make any amount > 0 with 0 coins\n",

    "        * __dp[amount] = dp[amount] + dp[amount - coin]__\n",
    "            - since we only use 1 row for the entire dp algorithm, we can drop 1 dimension from our dp which just leaves us with the amount, j\n",
    "    - dropping the row dimension also allows us to change the outer loop to instead loop using values instead of the i index\n",
