    "***\n",
    "* Time Complexity:\n",
    "    - naive: O(n$^{2}$)\n",
    "        * if a gas station's currCost > 0, meaning gas[i] - cost[i] > 0, then we recurse on it\n",
    "        * our recursion will attempt to go from n...n in a circuit\n",
    "        * therefore, if every gas station was viable, at most we will see n$^{2}$ subproblems\n",
    "    - greedy: O(n)\n",
    "        * we just loop from 1...n which is just O(n)\n",
    "* Space Complexity:\n",
    "    - naive: O(n)\n",
    "        * uses recursion so requires space for functions in the stack\n",
    "        * the number of functions is bounded by the length of the array since the recursion will stop when there's no more gas or when it reaches the same index it started the circuit on\n",
    "    - greedy: O(1)\n",
    "        * only requires space for a couple of variables\n",
    "***\n",
    "* naive:\n",
    "    - manually start the circuit from every index if gas[i] > cost[i] and continue until it reaches back to i\n",
    "    - for every recursive call, we check if there's any gas left and if the current gas station can supply us the necessary amount to get us to the next station\n",
    "        * if it doesn't then we move onto the next gas station as the new circuit start\n",
    "* greedy:\n",
    "    - algorithm is similar to Maximum Subarray/Kadane's algorithm\n",
    "    - our first assumption is this:\n",
    "        * if sum(gas) < sum(cost), then return -1\n",
    "        * if we don't even have enough gas in total to get through the entire circuit, then there's no point in iterating over the entire thing\n",
    "    - for the algorithm, we keep track of the totalGas and the current runningGas\n",
    "        * the totalGas is used to determine our first assumption\n",
    "        * the runningGas is what helps us determine if the current gas station start is good enough to run the entire circuit\n",
    "    - if we reach a gas station that cannot supply us enough gas to get to the next one, we then make that one our start\n",
    "        * so if (runningGas + currCost) < currCost, where currcost = gas[i] - cost[i], then we update the startIndex\n",
    "        * we keep doing this until the loop ends\n",
    "    - this is similar to Maximum Subarray b/c we know that if we have an array with all negative numbers in the first half and all positive in the second half, we only care about the second half\n",
    "        * e.g. [-1, -2, -3, 3, 2, 1], we only care about [3, 2, 1] so we start there\n",
    "        * the same can be said about this algorithm\n",
    "        * why should we care about indices that we cannot reach when there are more in the future that possibly can?\n",
    "    - how did we arrive at this solution?\n",
    "        * we created visualized an array that represents the net cost of all gas stations at i\n",
    "        * for example:\n",
    "            - gas:  [ 1,   2,  3,  4,  5]\n",
    "            - cost: [ 3,   4,  5,  1,  2]\n",
    "            - net:  [-2, -2,  -2,  3,  3]\n",
    "            - if we look at the net here, we see that it's pretty similar to our example above for Maximum Subarray"
